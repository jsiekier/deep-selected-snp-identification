# deep-selected-SNP-identification

Implementation of selected SNP and gene detection pipeline of the paper "Deep Unsupervised Identification of Selected Genes and SNPs in Pool-Seq Data from Evolving Populations" accepted in RECOMB-Genetics 2022.

# Running the code

## Dataset creation
.sync (with population estimates) and .fasta or .gff (with gene information) required


## Training the model

## Tracing selected SNPs

## Evaluation
